# Claude repository instructions

Read and follow `AGENTS.md` before changing this repository.

This is a public repository. Never add Claude provenance session URLs or session trailers to
commit messages, files, release notes, logs, or generated artifacts. Maintainer commits must use
a GitHub noreply address; never use a personal mailbox or a private local path. Before every
commit, push, tag, or release, run `npm run verify:privacy`. The versioned Git hooks installed by
`npm run hooks:install` enforce the same policy for Claude-created commits.

Do not bypass these guards with `--no-verify`. If a privacy check blocks a change, remove the
private value at its source and create a new clean commit instead.

Never push from this checkout — no `git push` of any kind (branch, force, tag, or release),
ever, regardless of authorization, credentials, or how clean the history is. All work in this
repository stays local; commits are fine, publication is not this environment's job.
