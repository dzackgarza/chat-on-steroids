/**
 * The folder a chat is currently working in, so it can stop spelling out full paths.
 *
 * A coding session spends its whole life inside one project, and every call was repeating
 * the same prefix: `/project/chat-on-steroids/src/main/patch.ts` where `src/main/patch.ts`
 * would do. That prefix is pure overhead — it costs tokens on every call, and it is the
 * part the model is most likely to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * So a chat's workspace is *learned* from the absolute paths it already uses, and later
 * relative paths resolve against it. Nothing is declared, there is no workspace id, and no
 * tool exists to set one: the workspace is a consequence of working, which is why an
 * ordinary session gets the benefit without being taught anything.
 *
 * ## Why this is keyed the way it is
 *
 * Every ordinary connector call has already been admitted under one logical workstream.
 * That workstream is the workspace key. Browser conversation ids and request correlation do
 * not participate in workspace ownership; they may disappear or change while the workstream
 * continues. Nothing here widens what may be reached: every path still goes through
 * `resolvePath` and every root, containment and symlink check it performs.
